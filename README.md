## MVC Architecture & Project Structure

This project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern to ensure a clean separation of business logic and views:

### Models (The Data)
Located in `app/Models/`, these files handle the database logic and data structure.
* **`Organization.php`**: The primary model for managing UPV student organization data and attributes.

### Views (The Interface)
Located in `resources/views/`, these define the user interface using Laravel's Blade engine.
* **`orgs/`**: Contains `index.blade.php` (the main directory) and `archived.blade.php` (the archive view).
* **`components/`**: Reusable Blade components like `modal-add-org.blade.php` and `toast.blade.php` to keep the code **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**.
* **`layouts/`**: The master `app.blade.php` file providing a consistent structure across all pages.

### Controllers (The Logic)
Located in `app/Http/Controllers/`.
* **`OrgController.php`**: The "brain" of the app, managing data flow between the models and views, including search, storage, and update logic.
